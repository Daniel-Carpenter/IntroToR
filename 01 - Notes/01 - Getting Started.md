## Getting help in R

### Packages

```R
?tidyverse
```

### Search potential name of function

```R
help.search("read")
```

```txt
[1] readr::readr
```

### Find the package of a function

```R
find("lm")
```

```txt
[1] "package:stats"
```

### Show all potential Functions based on Search

```R
apropos("lm")
```

```txt
[1] ". __C__anova.glm" ".__C__anova.glm.null" ". __C__glm"
[4] ". __C__glm.null" ". __C__lm" ". __C__mlm"
[7] "anova.glm" "anova.glmlist" "anova.lm"
. . .
```

### Check what packages are loaded

```R
search()
```

### Demo Package
```R
window()
demo(package)
```
