# Introduction 

Within the `Project1.Rmd` file and this `Project1.pdf` file, the user can create a
linear regression between two variables; also, the user can use a bootstrapping 
function. Within the function `myslr`, the user estimates the relationship between 
two variables, as well show the confidence in those estimates.

Within the bootstrapping function, the user can use a limited sample to infer 
information about a population.
 
  
# Data

Within the examples in this file, the `mtcars` data set provides meaningful information
when estimating linear regressions and bootstrapping. This data set includes information
from the 1974 \textit{Motor Trends} US magazine, and "comprises fuel consumption,"
as well as "10 aspects" of each of the thirty-two cars in the data set. These "aspects"
resemble the variables within the data.

When considering the variables in the `mtcars` data set, it is useful to understand the
types of data, which help best determine how to analyze the data. Please see the variables,
their descriptions, and their data types below.

## Interpretation of Model

Within the model, it estimates that an increase of 1,000 pounds in weight of a 
given car decreases the miles per gallon of the vehicle by 5.34. 
Additionally, the model estimates that changes in weight  account for 75.28% 
of the variation in the car's miles per gallon. 

At a 95% level of confidence, the model estimates the lower bound to be a 6.49 
decrease in miles per gallon when increasing the weight of a car by 1,000 pounds.
Alternatively, the model estimates the upper bound to be a 4.20 decrease in miles 
per gallon when increasing the weight of a car by 1,000 pounds.


## Validity of the model

Although the model estimates a narrow confidence interval with a relatively high 
R-squared value, we may not assume that solely weight accounts for the full 
76.28% variation in miles per gallon. This variable could easily be correlated 
with another relevant variable, thus confounding the simple linear regression.
